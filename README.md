clients satisaction that is meeting the expectations or needs of the customers which enables effective resource allocation.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
 Enables better decision-Making in terms of cost maintenance and time which Strategieses to Prevent Budget Overrun
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
flexibility-agile methodologies are highly flexible and adaptive to changes while Waterfall methodologies less flexible.advantage of agile it has imprved quality  Continuous testing and feedback lead to better identification of issues early, which improves the quality of the software disadvantage-agile requires experienced teams  Agile requires a high level of experience and commitment from the team advantage of waterfall-it is easy to manage,each phase has well-defined deliverables and milestones, making it easier for project managers to monitor progress and manage resources disadvantage it has Customer Feedback Delays,Customers usually only get to review the product at the end of the project, making it harder to incorporate changes based on feedback
 
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is particularly beneficial for projects that require flexibility, continuous feedback, and frequent delivery of incremental improvements. It's ideal for projects where the requirements may evolve or are not fully understood at the beginning.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Defining Clear Requirements and Acceptance Criteria which ensures that everyone understands what "success" looks like and the project team can verify that the software meets these criteria at each phase of development
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
